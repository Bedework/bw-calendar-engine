/**
 * A system event - like adding something, updating something, startup, shutdown
 * etc.
 * <p>
 * The Notifications interface uses these to carry information about system
 * events. Listeners can be registered for particular system event types.
 * <p>
 * sub-classes should define the compareTo() and hashCode methods. They should
 * also define fields and methods appropriate to the type of event.
 * <p>
 * For example, the ENTITY_UPDATE event should contain enough information to
 * identify the entity, e.g. the path for a calendar or a uid for the event. It
 * is probably NOT a good idea to have a reference to the actual entity.
 * <p>
 * Some of these events may be persisted to ensure their survival across system
 * restarts and their generation is considered part of the operation.
 * <p>
 * Note that we do not modify system events once they are persisted. We retrieve
 * them and delete them from the database.
